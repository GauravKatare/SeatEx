# “Alone We Can Do So Little; Together we can do so much”
### Our idea is to develop an android app which provides a platform which helps all those people travelling through train to get their desired seat position by exchanging their seats which especially helps when large group of people travel to large public gatherings such as Kumbh and some of the group members are unable to get seat with their groups. So our app facilitates them to exchange their seats especially in case of:
1. Senior-Citizens --> Incase of emergency or Tatkal Tickets many of times they are not able to get Lower berths which facilitate their journey.
2. Women --> Grouping women together make them more secure and make their journey easy as many of them need Lower-Berths due to sophisticated dressing. Especially in case of pregnant women.
3. Students --> Large group of students travel to colleges and homes during breaks but are scattered throughout the train so this helps to group them together. Bringing them together is a good way to protect these less Experienced passengers from any further harm.  
4. Public-Gatherings --> Families travel through train for functions such as Kumbh-Mela, Marriage-Functions but many of times they are unable to get seats in train together.
On any given day, 12617 trains were running on Indian Railway tracks. The total number of passengers carried in 2012-13 was 8.421 billion (842.1 crore!) 23.07 million (2.3 crore or 2 % of population of country) passengers were on the move on any given day.

### Main Focus of our App is to enhance the comfort of the large number of passengers by organizing and grouping the crowd at maximum extent.
